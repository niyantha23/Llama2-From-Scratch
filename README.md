# Llama2-From-Scratch

Llama2 is a state-of-the-art language model that has demonstrated impressive performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In this repository, we implement Llama2 from scratch using Python and pyTorch. The goal is to provide a clear and detailed explanation of each component, making it easier to understand how such models are built and how they function.
